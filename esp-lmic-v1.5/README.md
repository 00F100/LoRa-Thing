LMiC 1.5 port to ESP8266
========================
(c) M. Westenberg
This sketch demonstrates that LMIC 1.5 works on ESP8266 after making the necessary modifications. 
LMIC is the original LoRaMAC-in-C library which was developed by IBM, and was modified 
by Matthijs Kooijman and Thomas Telkomp to run on Arduino (the Teensy etc.)

After some modifications it runs on the ESP8266 as well.

Supported MCU's
---------------
In principle the Library and the sketch will work on every ESP8266, as until today all
of my sketches work on NodeMCU 0.9 and NodeMCU 1.0 systems and lookalikes.
I do have less favourable experience with bare ESP-xx implementations.

The sensor has been tested on my Wemos D1-mini MCU, but more to follow.

Documentation
-------------
Some material has been put together to help build this node.
